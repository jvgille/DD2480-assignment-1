### A hypothetical anti-ballistic missile
A DECIDE()-function was created that uses radar-tracking information (a set of planar data points and a set of conditions) to resolve several _Launch Interceptor Conditions_ (LIC's). DECIDE() then combines these with a _Logical Connector Matrix_ (LCM) in order to consider combinations of LICs and the result is used to generate a launch-unlock signal.   

### Structure
The code can be found in the __/src/main__ folder, and all the tests, every LIC has its own test, can be found in the __/src/test__ folder .
